# Hey there! My name is Amanda 👋

I'm an Analytics Engineer based in Spain, with over 7 years of experience working with data in diverse startups such as Nubank and Farfetch.

Recently, I’ve stepped into the gaming industry working on the Stumble Guys franchise @ Scopely. Here, I share my passion about solving complex problems, crafting scalable data solutions, and turning insights into meaningful impact. 

Beyond my full-time role, I also love spreading the data love as an analytics instructor in various bootcamps and courses worldwide! 🌐✨
